        <section id="problem">
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <h3>A Brief Description About the Current Scenario</h3>
            <p>The current scene regarding land pollution and soil infertility paints a concerning picture of environmental degradation. Rampant use of chemical fertilizers has led to soil degradation, reduced fertility, and contamination of groundwater. These practices not only harm the soil but also affect the quality and safety of our food supply. Excessive use of fertilizers contributes to nutrient imbalances in crops, leading to health issues like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and certain cancers in consumers. These adverse effects not only endanger public health but also hinder sustainable development by compromising the long-term viability of agricultural systems and ecosystems, emphasizing the urgent need for eco-friendly farming practices.</p>
            <h3>The Global Warming Effect</h3>
            <p>Global warming makes land pollution and soil problems worse. It changes rain and causes droughts or floods, harming soil. The heat also makes soil worse faster. This makes growing food harder and harms health and development. We need to act fast to fix this.</p>
            <h3>The Urban challenge</h3>
            <p>The challenge of urban food production, where space constraints and busy lifestyles make traditional gardening difficult. This problem is significant due to the growing need for sustainability and self-sufficiency in food sources within urban environments.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="solution">
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <h3>Problem Statement:</h3>
            <p>Our project, Home Farmer, aims to address the pressing issues of soil degradation, land pollution, and the growing need for sustainable urban farming. These challenges are critical due to their impact on food security, environmental health, and sustainable development. Though home farming is recognized, only a few individuals engage in it, particularly upon realizing the negative impacts of regularly consuming chemically fertilized food. Our robotic solution aims to tackle this issue effectively and ensure sustainable life on land.</p>
            
            <h3>Why This Problem</h3>
            <p>We chose this problem because conventional farming practices often contribute to soil degradation and pollution through the heavy use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and intensive land cultivation. Urbanization further exacerbates these issues by reducing available arable land and increasing pollution levels.</p>
            
            <h3>Robotic Solution</h3>
            <p>Home Farmer is a cutting-edge robotic solution designed to revolutionize farming practices. It is capable of autonomously planting seeds, nurturing crops, providing daily water requirements, and monitoring plant health. By incorporating sensors and sustainable farming techniques, Home Farmer minimizes soil disturbance, optimizes resource usage, and reduces reliance on harmful chemicals. The solution also reduces the human efforts for farming and makes it easily available at home.</p>
            
            <h3>Value of the Robotic Solution</h3>
            <p>The implementation of Home Farmer in real-life scenarios offers immense value. It significantly reduces soil erosion, conserves water through precise irrigation, eliminates the need for chemical inputs, and promotes healthy plant growth. This not only improves crop yields but also enhances soil fertility and biodiversity. Furthermore, Home Farmer enables efficient urban farming, making it possible to produce fresh, healthy food. By dedicating minimal time to farming, individuals can enjoy freshly grown plants without the use of fertilizers, all conveniently at their doorstep. This is achievable without disrupting their daily schedules, work commitments, or leisure time, thanks to our Farm bot.</p>
            
            <h3>Importance of the Project</h3>
            <p>Home Farmer is crucial in addressing global challenges related to food production, environmental sustainability, and urban development. By promoting sustainable farming practices, reducing pollution, and conserving natural resources, our project contributes to building resilient agricultural systems and ensures a healthier future for both people and the planet.</p>

            <h2>Home Farmer - Origins & Overview</h2>
            <h3>Origins of the Idea:</h3>
            <p>The concept of Home Farmer emerged from our deep concern about the environmental impact of traditional farming methods and the challenges posed by urbanization on agricultural practices. We recognized the need for a sustainable solution that could address soil degradation, land pollution, and the growing demand for urban farming. Although established farming techniques exist, it's surprising that home farming isn't more popular. This is especially concerning given the harmful effects of pesticides on daily consumed crops. To tackle this issue, we came up with a simple and cost-effective solution â€“ introducing Home Farmer.</p>

            <h2>Our Journey</h2>
            <h3>How we got the idea for our solution</h3>
            <p>When we found a pricey commercial farmbot used in big farms, we liked its features but couldn't afford it. So, we decided to make our own version which can be used in homes. We wanted something cheaper and easier for home use. By taking ideas from the expensive one and simplifying them, we aimed to create a friendly and affordable system for home farming.</p>
            
            <h3>Mechanical Construction - V2</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3D printed parts provide structural support and secure aluminum profiles.</li>
                <li>Aluminum profiles provide horizontal support.</li>
                <li>Belt and trolley provide movement for X and Y axes.</li>
                <li>Allen bolts connect aluminum profiles to 3D printed parts.</li>
                <li>Linear bearings and lead screw facilitate Z axis movement.</li>
                <li>Ball bearings reduce rotational friction for Z axis.</li>
                <li>Couplers connect stepper motors to pulley.</li>
                <li>The belt goes around 1 axis, with the ends connecting to the trolley, which is then moved by the stepper motors.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Coding of the Solution</h3>
            <p>The code automates movement with stepper motors and a servo, looping through predefined actions based on the XY-coordinate system. It's part of a robotics or automation project, requiring precise motor control. Additionally, it features a 20x4 LCD for real-time updates on the bot's function and seeding recommendations, with a switch for instant plant watering. This indicates its integration into a formalized project, possibly in robotics or automation, demanding meticulous motor control for synchronized operations.</p>

            <h3>Social Impact of the Product</h3>
            <p>The Home Farmer robot helps everyone grow fresh, healthy vegetables right at home, even in small spaces like apartments. This means people get safe, chemical-free food, reducing the need for harmful pesticides and fertilizers that damage our soil and water. By using Home Farmer, we promote healthier eating habits and protect our environment from pollution. It also encourages families and kids to learn about farming and caring for our planet.
