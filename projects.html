        <!-- MediBot -->
        <section class="project-item" id="medibot">
            <h2>MediBot <br>(<i>Active</i>)</h2>
            <p><strong>Time Built:</strong> <i>(Yet to be built)</i></p>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To help the elderly and chronic patients avoid missed doses.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>What I will learn from this:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Independant Work.</li>
                    <li>Giving back to the community.</li>
                    <li>How to properly make a project with all required steps.</li>
                    <li>Learning to do most with the least money.</li>
                </ul>

        <!-- Home Farmer -->
        <section class="project-item" id="home-farmer">
            <h2>Home Farmer <br>(<i>Active</i>)</h2>
            <p><strong>Time Built:</strong> First prototype in April 2024; Latest prototype in September 2024;</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Why I built this:</strong> <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Everyone gets fresh, healthy food in the comfort of their home.</li>
                    <li>The Project matches the theme of Earth Allies (WRO 2024).</li>
                    <li>The robot is useful to the community and the environment, both at the same time!</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>What I learnt from this:</strong> <i>(Don't worry if you don't know all this, I was also there once)</i> 
                <ul>
                    <li>How to use stepper motors.</li>
                    <li>How to use a CNC Shield V3 to control stepper motors with a DRV8825.</li>
                    <li>What a Rotary Encoder is.</li>
                    <li>Introduction to GRBL.</li>
                    <li>How to combine all of this to make a working, semi-automatic robot.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>My Experience:</strong> 
                I learnt how to do all of the things listed above, while working with my teammate to make the Home Farmer a reality!
                (Though we did not get selected for the National Round, we still got a chance at the Regional and I think we killed it!)

        <!-- Line Follower Robot -->
        <section class="project-item" id="line-follower">
            <h2>Line Follower Robot <br>(<i>Completed</i>)</h2>
            <p><strong>Time Built:</strong> Once in 2024 and again in 2025.</p>
            <p><strong>Why I built this:</strong> For the Annual Techradiance Line Follower Championship (8th and 9th Edition)</p>
            <p><strong>Tech Used:</strong> Arduino Uno, IR Sensors, Battery (12V), Motors, Motor Driver (L293D), and more minor components</p>
            <p>
                <strong>My Experience (First Time):</strong> 
                I did a lot of testing, but I didn't consider the possibility that the track would be under a bright light and would be very reflective.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>My Experience (Second Time):</strong> 
                This time I tested with the scenario of light in consideration, using special IR sensors, but it went off-course anyway because of an air bubble that affected the IR sensors.
